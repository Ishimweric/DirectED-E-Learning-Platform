    "text": "<s>[INST] What is `response_model_exclude_unset` for? [/INST] Setting `response_model_exclude_unset=True` in the path operation decorator tells FastAPI to only include values in the response that were explicitly set in the returned data object. Fields that still have their default Pydantic model values will be omitted from the final JSON output.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] How would you handle a request that can be both synchronous and asynchronous? [/INST] If a dependency or part of your code is synchronous (e.g., a CPU-bound library), you should run it in an external thread pool to avoid blocking the server's event loop. FastAPI can do this automatically for `def` functions, or you can use `run_in_threadpool` from `starlette.concurrency`.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What is the purpose of the `AnyIO` library in FastAPI's internals? [/INST] FastAPI uses `AnyIO` as its concurrency backend. `AnyIO` provides a compatibility layer that allows the same asynchronous code to run on different event loops, primarily `asyncio` and `trio`. This makes FastAPI's internal async handling more flexible and robust.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] How can you access the raw `Request` object in FastAPI? [/INST] You can get access to the underlying Starlette `Request` object by adding a parameter to your path operation function with the type hint `Request`. This is useful when you need to access request details that are not directly exposed by FastAPI, such as client IP or specific headers.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What are callable dependencies? [/INST] A dependency can be any 'callable' that FastAPI can execute, most commonly a function. However, you can also use a class as a dependency. In this case, FastAPI will treat the class itself as a factory and call it to create a new instance for each request.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] How can you stream a response in FastAPI? [/INST] To stream a response, you can return a `StreamingResponse` object. This response takes an asynchronous generator function as input. FastAPI will then iterate over the generator and send each yielded chunk of data to the client, which is ideal for large files or data streams.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What is a singleton dependency? [/INST] By default, dependencies are re-computed for every request. To create a 'singleton' dependency that is created only once and shared across all requests, you can manage its state outside the dependency function (e.g., as a global variable) and use the `startup` event to initialize it.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What is the role of a reverse proxy like Nginx when deploying Uvicorn? [/INST] A reverse proxy like Nginx sits in front of your Uvicorn server in production. It can handle tasks like terminating SSL (HTTPS), load balancing requests across multiple Uvicorn workers, serving static files directly, and providing an additional layer of security.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] Can you use a synchronous function (`def`) instead of `async def` in FastAPI? [/INST] Yes, you can. If you use a regular `def` function for a path operation, FastAPI is smart enough to run it in an external thread pool. This prevents the synchronous code from blocking the server's main event loop, ensuring the application remains responsive.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] How can you get the client's IP address in FastAPI? [/INST] You can access the client's IP address from the underlying Starlette `Request` object. Add a parameter `request: Request` to your path operation function, and then you can access the IP from `request.client.host`. This is especially useful for logging or rate-limiting.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] How does FastAPI handle a request body with multiple media types? [/INST] FastAPI uses the `Content-Type` header to determine how to parse the request body. While a single path operation typically expects one format (like JSON), you can build more complex logic by inspecting the `Content-Type` header from the raw `Request` object to handle different formats.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What are some alternatives to Uvicorn for running FastAPI? [/INST] While Uvicorn is the recommended server, FastAPI can be run by other ASGI-compliant servers. Alternatives include Hypercorn, which supports more features like HTTP/2 and Trio, and Daphne, which is the official ASGI server from the Django project.</s>"
