    "text": "<s>[INST] The guide also says to keep the design simple, but then mentions using 'real content.' When should I use actual text instead of 'lorem ipsum'? [/INST] That's a great question. While simple placeholders are fine for early-stage layouts, the guide recommends using real content for content-rich interfaces. When you're working on the information architecture, like menu items or headings, using real text is much more useful for evaluating the user experience than just seeing 'menu item 1, 2, 3, 4'.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] How do I know when my wireframe is actually finished and ready for the next stage?

  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What is the goal of 'packaging design'? [/INST] Packaging design is a very important part of product marketing. Its goal is to create a package that not only looks good but also influences purchasing decisions and helps a product stand out from its competitors on a crowded shelf.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] I'm learning about the design process. Is there more to being a designer than just making things look good? [/INST] Yes, absolutely. A designer's job is much more than just the visual aspect. A large part of it is about identifying real problems, asking the right questions, and creating solutions that are truly helpful for people. This is where design ethics come into play.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What are 'design ethics'? [/INST] Design ethics is the practice of considering the real-world impact of your work. It's about recognizing that the products and services you create can help or harm people, and taking that responsibility seriously by aiming to solve real problems and improve people's lives.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] Can you give me an example of an ethical design choice? [/INST] Certainly. Instead of creating another weather app, which is a problem that's mostly solved, an ethical designer might create an app that helps transgender individuals find safe public restrooms. This addresses a real, serious problem that affects a vulnerable community.</s>"

    "text": "<s>[INST] I've heard the term 'unconscious bias.' What does that mean? [/INST] Unconscious bias is when cultural stereotypes or past experiences influence how our minds process new information, without us even being aware of it. Our brains naturally look for patterns to make quick judgments, but those patterns can be based on harmful stereotypes.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] Why do designers need to be aware of their own unconscious biases? [/INST] Designers need to be aware of their biases because those biases can unintentionally shape their work, potentially leading to designs that exclude or misrepresent certain groups of people. For example, an illustration style might not reflect the diversity of the product's actual users.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] Can you give an example of how bias can affect a design process? [/INST] Imagine designing an app for a global audience. If you only leave enough space in a button for a short English word, that button might break when the text is translated to a language like German, where the equivalent word is much longer. This is a bias toward your own language.</s>"

[/INST] Inclusion in design means creating products or services that are accessible to and usable by as many people as reasonably possible. It's about being aware that people have different needs and abilities, and actively working to avoid excluding anyone.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] Why is it so important to design inclusively? [/INST] It's incredibly important because a significant portion of the global population, over one billion people, has some form of impairment. Designing inclusively not only helps you reach this large audience but often improves the product experience for everyone.</s>"

  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] What is 'accessibility' in design? [/INST] Accessibility is the degree to which your product is usable by the broadest range of people, including those with disabilities. A great real-world example is a wheelchair ramp—it's essential for someone in a wheelchair but can also be helpful for someone pushing a stroller.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] It feels awkward talking about disabilities. What's the best way to approach it? [/INST] It's okay to be unsure about the right language to use.

    "text": "<s>[INST] What is a simple way I can make my website more accessible for people with visual impairments? [/INST] A very important and simple way is to add 'alt text' to every image in your website's code. This provides a text description of the image that can be read aloud by a screen reader, giving a person with reduced vision access to that visual information.</s>"
  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] I've also heard the term 'usability.' How is that different from accessibility? [/INST] Usability is about how easy, intuitive, and efficient a product is to use for a specific goal. While accessibility is about making sure people *can* use it, usability is about making sure it's a *good experience* when they do. A product can be accessible but still difficult to use.</s>"
  },

  },
  {
    "text": "<s>[INST] When I interview customers, should I just ask them what they want in a product? [/INST] It's better to focus on their past behavior rather than asking them directly what they want. Ask them open-ended questions about how they have dealt with their problems in the past.

    "text": "<s>[INST] When I'm starting a new design, should I focus on the layout first or the content? [/INST] While it can be tempting to jump right into the layout, it's actually best to work on the content—the words and information—first. Designing with real or near-final content helps you create a more effective and realistic final product.</s>"
  },
